# Wormhole_Mouseclick
Mouse click on a primary floating gui button will make a mouse click on the position of secondary floating gui.

# INSTALLATION
Windows PC:
1) download the portal.ahk file
2) install autohotkey from official site: https://autohotkey.com/

Android:
1) download the WormHole.zip file
2) build the file using Android Studio


# What is it?
Imagine when you need to click on a button on your screen frequently, but you dont want to move your mouse to that position ( it could be faraway from your initial mouse position ). So, this application is the solution for you.

# ISSUES & SOLUTIONS
1) Both of the floating Guis cannot move over the top of screen. ( left, right, bottom can )
   ==> maybe a little adjustment on the size of the Gui might help?!
